//! Text fingerprints: canonicalisation, word-3-shingles and a 128-word
//! MinHash signature (design spec §4, tier-2 text lane).
//!
//! Part of the `pith` suite: every crate in the suite builds without a
//! single registry package.
//!
//! # Pipeline
//!
//! 1. [`canonicalize`]: NFC (via `pith_unicode::nfc`) → lowercase →
//!    strip trailing whitespace → exactly one `'\n'`.
//! 2. Words = `split_whitespace` runs of the canonical text; combining
//!    marks stay attached to their base letter (accents are kept —
//!    stripping them would erase distinctions Vietnamese relies on).
//! 3. Shingles = consecutive `k`-word windows, `k = min(3, n)` for an
//!    `n`-word document; hashed with FNV-1a 64 over the words joined by
//!    a single ASCII space.
//! 4. [`signature`] = 128-word MinHash: permutation `i` draws `seed_i`
//!    from `SplitMix64::new(SEED_STREAM)` and each signature word is
//!    `min over shingles of sm64_mix(fnv1a64(shingle) ^ seed_i)`,
//!    where `sm64_mix` is the splitmix64 output function applied as a
//!    pure finalizer (spec §4: `splitmix64(FNV1a64(w) ^ seed_i)`).
//!
//! The crate is `no_std`: only `alloc` containers and `core` string
//! operations are used, so the same code runs on embedded targets. The
//! `std` feature (on by default) links `std` so the `cdylib` the
//! language SDKs bind through carries a panic handler.

#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]
// `unsafe` is denied everywhere except `ffi`, the C ABI surface the
// language SDKs bind through: raw pointers exist only at that boundary,
// and every exported function is a documented `unsafe extern "C"` fn.
